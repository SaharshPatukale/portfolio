Portfolio — Final redesign (mobile-first)
Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- resume_saharsh.pdf
- assets/ (profile and project SVG placeholders)
- projects/modern-landing/index.html (demo)

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Upload all files and folders preserving structure.
3. In Settings -> Pages, select branch 'main' (or 'gh-pages') and root (/).
4. Save and wait a minute; your site will be at https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/

Notes:
- Edit 'assets/*.svg' with your real images for better visuals.
- Update project links and source URLs inside index.html if you have them.
- The Google Form is embedded in the Contact section already.
